                        One of my strongest points is Front-end Development. I love figuring out the most maintainable, 
                        reusable ways of building components
                    </strong>

                <p>I'm constantly on the look out to learn and experience new things, be it web related or anything out of the ordinary! 
                    Occasionally I do side projects for my clients to help their full online potential & reach their conversion goals. 
                    If you have any questions, or need some advice on a project, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. I'd love to chat with you.</p>
